- Microservices is an architectural pattern
  - Application as suite of small services
  - Each service runs in own process
  - Communicate via lightweight protocols
- Characteristics

  - Independently deployable
  - Organized around business capabilities
  - Decentralized data management
  - Infrastructure automation
  - Design for failure
- Benefits
  - Technology diversity
    - Choose best tool for each service
  - Independent scaling
  - Easier to understand and modify
  - Fault isolation
  - Faster deployment cycles
- Challenges
  - Distributed system complexity
  - Network latency
  - Data consistency
  - Testing complexity
  - Operational overhead
- Communication patterns
  - Synchronous: [[REST API]], [[GraphQL]]
  - Asynchronous: Message queues, events
  - Service mesh for service-to-service
- Supporting technologies
  - [[Docker]] for containerization
  - [[Kubernetes]] for orchestration
  - API Gateway for routing
  - Service discovery (Consul, Eureka)
  - Distributed tracing (Jaeger)
- Data management
  - Database per service pattern
  - Event sourcing
  - CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
  - Saga pattern for distributed transactions
- When to use microservices
  - Large, complex applications
  - Need for independent scaling
  - Multiple teams
  - Different technology requirements
- When NOT to use
  - Small applications
  - Simple domains
  - Limited team size
  - Starting a new project (start monolith)
