- Functional programming is a programming paradigm
  - Computation as evaluation of functions
  - Avoids changing state and mutable data
  - Declarative rather than imperative
- Core principles
  id:: 65a2c1f0-eeee-4567-89ab-cdef01234578
  - Pure functions
    - Same input always gives same output
    - No side effects
  - Immutability
    - Data cannot be modified after creation
  - First-class functions
    - Functions as values
  - Higher-order functions
    - Functions that take or return functions
- Common concepts
  - Map, filter, reduce
  - Function composition
  - Currying and partial application
  - Recursion instead of loops
  - Lazy evaluation
- Benefits
  - Easier to reason about
  - Easier to test
  - Better for concurrency
  - Enables optimization
  - Referential transparency
- Functional languages
  - Haskell (purely functional)
  - Clojure (Lisp dialect)
  - Elixir (built on Erlang)
  - F# (.NET language)
- FP in [[Python]]
  - map(), filter(), reduce()
  - List comprehensions
  - Lambda functions
  - functools module
  - itertools module
- Challenges
  - Performance overhead
  - Harder to learn initially
  - Not always natural for stateful problems
  - Debugging can be trickier
- Practical adoption
  - Mix with other paradigms
  - Use pure functions where possible
  - Immutable data structures
  - Avoid global state
