- Started work at 8:30am
- Fixed bug in user authentication
  - Issue was with session timeout
  - Updated config
- [[Pytest]] fixtures can have different scopes
  - session, module, class, function
  - Session-scoped fixtures run once for entire test suite
  - Use for expensive setup like database creation
  - Be careful with test isolation though

- The difference between [[Flask]] and [[Django]]
  - Flask gives you freedom to choose components
  - Django provides everything out of the box
  - Flask is better when you need precise control
  - Django is faster to start for standard web apps

- Dentist appointment 2pm
  - Took 1.5 hours
- [[Git]] rebase vs merge
  - Rebase creates linear history
  - Merge preserves branch history
  - Use rebase for feature branches before merging
  - Never rebase commits that have been pushed to shared branches
    - This rewrites history and breaks others' work
