# Specification Quality Checklist: Interactive TUI for Knowledge Extraction

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-29
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All validation items pass. The specification is complete and ready for planning phase.

**Update 2025-10-29**: Clarified that backward compatibility is NOT required - this feature replaces the existing batch mode entirely. CLI interface can be redesigned freely.

### Validation Details:

**Content Quality**: ✓ Pass

- Specification focuses on user interactions and outcomes
- User-friendly terminology used throughout (e.g., "Add as new section" vs technical "APPEND_ROOT")
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete
- No code examples or implementation details present

**Requirement Completeness**: ✓ Pass

- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers exist - all requirements are fully specified
- All 45 functional requirements are testable (e.g., FR-003: "System MUST display confidence scores as percentages")
- Success criteria are measurable (e.g., SC-002: "500ms response time", SC-004: "under 3 minutes")
- Success criteria avoid implementation details (focused on user experience and timing)
- 20 acceptance scenarios defined across 5 user stories
- 8 edge cases identified with expected behaviors
- Scope clearly bounded with "Out of Scope" section
- Dependencies and assumptions sections completed

**Feature Readiness**: ✓ Pass

- Each functional requirement maps to user scenarios and acceptance criteria
- User scenarios cover all 4 phases plus error handling
- Success criteria align with user value (navigation without docs, responsive feedback, user control)
- No implementation leakage detected
