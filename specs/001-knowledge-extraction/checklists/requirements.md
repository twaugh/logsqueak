# Specification Quality Checklist: Knowledge Extraction from Journals

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED (updated after outline format clarification)

All checklist items passed after revision:

- **Content Quality**: Specification focuses on WHAT (extract knowledge, preview changes, integrate to pages in outline format) without specifying HOW (Python, LLM libraries, parsing implementation). Written for stakeholders who understand Logseq but not necessarily technical implementation.

- **Requirement Completeness**: All 15 functional requirements are specific, testable, and unambiguous. Success criteria use measurable metrics (time, accuracy percentages, 100% safety guarantees). Edge cases cover common failure scenarios. Scope is bounded to v1 additive operations with clear roadmap for future features.

- **Feature Readiness**: Each user story has clear acceptance scenarios. Three-tier priority structure (P1: extract/preview, P2: integrate, P3: create organizational bullets) provides MVP path. Success criteria focus on user outcomes (30 sec extraction time, 80% accuracy, 100% data safety) not implementation metrics.

## Revision History

- **2025-10-22 (initial)**: First validation pass - all items passed
- **2025-10-22 (outline clarification)**: Updated to clarify Logseq outline format requirements:
  - User Story 3: Changed from "create sections" to "create organizational bullets matching page conventions"
  - FR-005, FR-006, FR-007: Updated to reference bullets and outline hierarchy
  - FR-010: Clarified outline format (bullets with indentation, not flat markdown)
  - Key Entities: Updated to reference outline structure throughout
  - Assumptions: Added clarification that all pages use outline structure and may have different organizational conventions
- **2025-10-22 (success criteria fix)**: Removed hardware-dependent timing requirements:
  - SC-001: Changed from "under 30 seconds" to "clear progress feedback during extraction"
  - SC-006: Changed from "under 2 minutes total" to "successfully process... regardless of LLM response time"
  - Rationale: LLM response times depend on hardware (local vs. cloud, GPU vs. CPU) which users don't control

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase
- All assumptions documented (existing Logseq graph, API access, outline format, CLI comfort)
- Constitution principles reflected: non-destructive operations (FR-002, FR-006, FR-008), dry-run mode (FR-002, SC-007), provenance (FR-003, SC-003), POC simplicity (Assumptions section)
- **Critical design point**: System must detect and match each page's existing organizational conventions (plain bullets vs. bullets with markdown headings)
